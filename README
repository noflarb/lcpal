LCPAL - Leon County Property Appraiser Library

= What is it?
LCPAL is a Ruby interface to the Leon County Florida property appraiser's web based search. It was conceived by James Akers and started by Joe Martinez as an open source project of the North Florida Ruby Brigade - NoFlaRB.

Its intended purpose is to allow ruby developers to access this public data within their applications.
